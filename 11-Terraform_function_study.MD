## Terraform_function

The Terraform language does not support user-defined functions, and so only the functions built in to the language are available for use. A list of all of the available built-in functions listed below.

You can experiment with the behavior of Terraform's built-in functions from the Terraform expression console, by running the **terraform console** command:

> max(5, 12, 9)
